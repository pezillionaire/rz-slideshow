# Submission by Andrew [Pez] Pengelly

This is my Submission for the Slideshow Excercise Challenge.

Since the overall concept is simple I wanted to provide a solution that avoided cruft of frontend frameworks, build systems, or package managers. My personal goal was to provide a solution that could be run in the browser without any setup.

## How to run

Keep the contents of this project as is and simply open the `index.html` in your browser of choice.

# Programming Exercise - Slideshow

The goal of this exercise is to build a simple slideshow.

The slideshow should:
 - work on desktop, tablets, and mobile
 - display the images provided in the images folder
 - track how many times each picture is viewed (does not need to be stored between refreshes)

## Guidelines

* **Please DO NOT fork this repository with your solution**
* Use any language or frameworks you want
* Only use code that you have license to use
* Don't hesitate to ask us any questions to clarify the project
